# Projects


## Band gap prediction with SHAP-guided features
- **What:** Random Forest / XGBoost / LightGBM pipelines with SHAP-based feature selection; Bayesian tuning; R² ≈ 0.66 with pruned features.
- **Why it matters:** Reduced features without losing performance improves generalization and interpretability.
- **Tech:** Python, scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, SHAP, Optuna/Skopt.
- **Code:** https://github.com/submerged-in-matrix/materials-ml-projects-


## Oxidation state assignment (reproduction study)
- **What:** End‑to‑end reproduction targeting ~99.7% accuracy as reported; hyperparameter search to match paper results; SHAP interpretation.
- **Tech:** scikit-learn, data curation, evaluation parity checks, SHAP plots.
- **Code:** (add the repo link when ready)


## Patterns Matter (Flask/SQLite)
- **What:** Deployed app on Fly.io with persistent storage; CRUD, uploads, and templating.
- **Tech:** Flask, SQLite, Jinja, WSGI, Fly.io.
- **App / Code:** (add app URL) · https://github.com/submerged-in-matrix/ (add repo)
