# Band Gap Prediction — interpretable & reproducible


**Problem:** Build a transparent band‑gap predictor and data workflow.


**Approach:**
- Feature engineering via Matminer/Pymatgen; interpretable models with SHAP.
- Benchmarked tree ensembles (RF/XGB/LGBM) with careful validation.
- Semantic augmentation (see LLM + KG project) for discoverability.


**Results:**
- Stable baseline with clear SHAP rankings; integrated into knowledge graph prototype.
